Final Project 18-19: Game of Life

Conway's Game of Life is a game that requires no player other than the computer.

The grid created represents a colony of cells.  The game starts with a random dispersion of live and dead cells.

The game progresses through different generations, each generation different from the previous one.

The rules that determine changes between generations are as follows:

  A live cell with fewer than two neighbor dies (underpopulation)
  
  A live cell with two or three neighbors survives
  
  A live cell with more than three neighbors dies (overpopulation)
  
  A dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)
