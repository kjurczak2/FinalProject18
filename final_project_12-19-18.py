#Conway's Game of Life rules (found on Wikipedia):
    #1: Live cell with fewer than two neighbors dies (underpopulation)
    #2: Live cell with two or three neighbors lives
    #3: Live cell with more than three neighbors dies (overpopulation)
    #4: Dead cell with exactly three neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction)
